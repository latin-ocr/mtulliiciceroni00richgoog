for High Schools‚ Academies, and Colleges‚ aud as a book of
reference.

Eart'r Israel of American Literature is a companion vol-
urne to the “English Literature,” with which it corresponds in
general character and design. It is intended as a text-book for
High Schools, Academias, and Colleges‚ and as a book of
reference. ι

Burt's short (laurae lu literatura, English adduxerim,

is intended as a text-book for Schools and Academies. Itis
designed for the use of those who have not the time to devote
to the study of Literature as laid down in the larger books of
the Series.

ln these volumes Prof. Hart has embodied the matured fruits
of his life-long studies in this department of letters. We believe
they will be found in advance of any other text-books on the
subject, in the comprehensiveness of the plan, the freshness of
much of the materials‚ the sound judgment shown in the critical
opinions, the cleamess with which the several topics are pre·
sented, and the beauty as well as the practical convenience of the
mechanical arrangements.

ΤΙιε scholarly culture and excellent literary judgment dis· ’

played, entitle these books to a high place among the works on
English literature. Τὴε plan and arrangement present many
novel features, and the thoroughness of detail, brevity and pre-
cision of statement, elegance of style, and soundness of opinion
which characterize the volumes, call for the sincerest commen·

dation.
