tilian mentions as the most eminent oratore ol the period in
which they lived, the Laelii, Asitcawi, Catones, and Gracchi.
Cicero in his Brasos asserts that Scipio surpassed all his contem-
poraries, except Laelius, in eloquence not less than in learning
and wisdom. And Mommsen, indorsing the sentiment os the
ancient critice, styles the speeches of Scipio and Laelius “ master-
piecee ol model prose aa well as expressions of the noblest patri·
'otisml’

With such abilities and such testes Scipio becam a congenial
associate ol Laelius in efforts for the improvement os the national
language, and for the intellectual culture of their felleo-citizens,
as well as in their own savorite studies. United with them in a love
of learning, in echolnrly attainments, and in oratorical excellence,
were many men os high character and position in the State, such
as the consul L. Furius Philus, Fabius Maximus, the older brother
o'l' Scipio and the adopted aon of Fabius Cunctator ,· Sulpicius Galus,

the last chapter cl the essay. Among the younger members of
this group os scholare wore Laelia, the daughter cf Laelius, “ cel·

first to scale its walls, and who was also the author of a hIstory
of his own times.

With these coadjutore Scipio and Laelius led the way also in
the patronage of the most talented authors oi their day. Among
their familiar acquaintances, mingling in their society, sharing
their hospitality‚ and often beiriended by them, were Pacuvius,
one of the two geniuses oi that age in tragedy3 the comio poet
Terence, “whose wit and idiom were pointed and polished hy
their conversation,’' and whose plays,'inferior in purity ol diction to
no later classic productione except those ol (laesor and Cicero, were
ior this reason imputed by many to Laelius; Lucilius, the earliest
ol the lour Satirists and the equales his successors in the keenness
and severity ol his assaults upon the vices and sollies oi the hour3
