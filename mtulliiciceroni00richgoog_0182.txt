liert'r rirst hesron· ln composition is intended ior begin-
ners. Agreater help to the Teacher never was invented. It
will revolutionize the whole work os teaching. By the increased
power ol expression which it gives to the pupil‚ it doubles his
progress ln every study. There is not a school but in which
aclass can be formed forits advantageous use. ' Any pupil able
to read tolerably well can use it to advantage.

Hart'r composition and Rhetorio has been prepared with a
lull knowledge ol the wants os both teacher and scholar in this
important branch ol education, and the author has spared no
pains to make the book eminently practical aud adapted to use
in the class-room. Dr. Hart has been engaged lor more than
one-third oi a century in the practical duties οἱ the school·
room, and lor years past has made a specialty ol the subjectos
which the present volume treats. The great variety and copious·
ness ol the “ Examples lor Practlce'' will commend the book to

general lavor. In this respect it is unequalled by any similar
work heretolore published.
