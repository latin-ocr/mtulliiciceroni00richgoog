oa resacrare, 73

lum the same year with Scipio Africanus Major, B. (l. 234, cl' a
plebeiae family, he entered the army at the age oi seventeen, and
gained experience in war by service during the whole coptest
with Hannibal, from the battle ol Trasimenus ιο ιΙτο final victory
at Zama, under the ablest ol the Roman generals in that eventful
struggle—Fabius, Marcellus, Nero, and Scipio. 'l'he military
ahilities hethan developed were more conspicuously exhibited in
a campaign in Spain during his consulship, B. 0. 195, in which
the consummate skill of his pians oi battle, his brilliant manoeu-
vres, bis indefatigable energy, boldness, and rapidity ol movement
bave given him among modern judges the reputation ci “mili-
tary genius ol a very high order.'' Later, when tribune under
Glabrio in the war against King Antiochus, liis during and diffi-
cult moreh over the heights ιο the rear oi the enemy won the
decisivo battle ol Thermopylae.

Before this career was sully ended, his official labore in civil
affairs had already begua in his praetcrship in Sardinia, B. 0.
198, end his administration ol the province ci Spain. llis most
valuable and characteristic services ιο his country, however, were
rendered during his censcrsbip, which began in the year 184, and
which the condition os the times made the more memorable. The
golden age cf the Republic was already drawing ιο a close. Its
foreign wara, which were breaking down thesaur other great pow-
ers ol the world, were also opening the way ior the luxuries aad
vices citha East, were sostering political corruption and stimu-
lating the passion for conquest. By nature and hy training Cato
was a statesman cs the old school, and therefore an antagonist ci
the new nobility ol wealth. Frugal and plain in his habits of liv-
ing, thcronghly honest, and loyal tc the State, a swern enemy cl
luxury and villainy ol every kind, the characteres the ancient
⁸ liemon was the ideal he sought to reproduce in his cwn lile. His

determination tc wield the whole power os the censcrship lor the
’ removal of publio and private offences, by the avowal os which he
had won that office, he carried out ιο the letter without lear or
lavor. Efficient in the discharge of its other duties-the taking
of the census, and the superintendence of public buildings and
works-he was especially malcus in that regulation ol the morale ’
olbisfellow-citinens, which was tbe almost despotic prerogativa ol
his office. 'rhougn he was vigilant and uncompromising in the
exercise cf all its powers, and learless end relentless in degrading
unworthy senators end knights in the face of the bitter hostility
