HE text of this edition of the De Senectute and De
Amicitia is that of Baiter, iu the Tauchnitz series
of Cicero’s works edited by Baiter and Kayser, and
published in 1864, the merits of which are well known.

With this have been carefully compared the various Ι

readings given iu the Auuctutio Oritico of that work,
and the text of Orelli's edition revised since his death

by Halm (Zurich, 1861). In onlyavery few instaures, „-

however, has the reading of Baiter been exchanged for
any other3 while in all cases in which there is any
important difference, the readings of other critical*
authorities heve been cited in the Noas.

In conformity with the general plan of this series of
classical text-books, the chief design of the Notas is to
furnish the pupil with such assistance in understanding
the language and the thought of the author, as is actu·
ally needed at that stage ot' study at which these cssays Ι
are usually read. In the work of preparing them, free
use has been made of several German and English
commentaries‚ as well as of other works, of which a .
full list is given on page 7'0‚ aud to each of which
creditis given in the Notes.
