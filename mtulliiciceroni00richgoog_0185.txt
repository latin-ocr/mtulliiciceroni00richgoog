A.M.‚ Professor os Mathematics in the Phila·

delphia Central High School. Price by mail,

Tm present work is the result os an effort to produce an Ele·

mentary Algebra suited to the wants olclasses commencing the

study. It has been prepared by one who sor years has felt the

need ol just such a book, and is the fruit ol long experience
in the school-roem.

With this book in hand, the pupil cannot help avoiding the

difficulties which invariably present themselves at the very
threshold os the study of Algebra.

The great aim, throughout, has been to make everything as
plain as the nature ol the subject would permit. T here isa
continual review and repetition os wh'atever has been learned.
Much more attention than usual has been given to Fractions‚ as
adrill on thern is believed to be essentiai to a full comprehension
os Algehraic operations, and a ready sacility in perlorming them.

It has been the aim to give such a presentation os the subject
as will meet the wants ol Common Schools and Academies. lt
is an elementary work, and no attempt has been made to include
everything which might be brought under the head os Algebra.
The treatment os the subject is on the principle of “step by
step‚’' so that the pupil at the very outset is inspired with a de·
gree os confidence which induces sels-reliance; rendering un·
necessary a constant application to the teacher sor help.

The book is commended to teachers in the hope that it wizt

ᾑῖἰείγ a need which the author has himself frequently felt.
