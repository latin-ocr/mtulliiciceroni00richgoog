This book is what its title indicates, “ First Lessons in Natural
Philosophy ; ” and it presents each division ol the subject in such
an easy and familiar style, that it cannot fail to interest ancl in-
struct any child os ordinary intelligence. Beginning as it does
in a simple and easy manner, it secures the interest os the pupil
by first directing his attention to objects in nature with which he
isiamiliar. When the interest is thus excited‚ the subject is
gradually unsolded by presenting, one aster another, the familiar
things met with in the every-day walks ol lise ; thus, the most
common objects are made the means os teaching great philo-
sophical truths. Only so much of the subject is presented as can
be taught with profit in our public and private schools‚ yet what
hasbeen given will be found to embrace all the more common
phenomena met with in every-day lise. Τὴε facts are so clearly
and so plainly set forth, that they are entirely capable ol com·

prehensiou by those lor whose use and benefit this little work is
designed.
