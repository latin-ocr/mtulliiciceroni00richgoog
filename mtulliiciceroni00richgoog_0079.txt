against persons.”

That ‘his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated’ down
ιο ιιο very end of his life there is the clearest evidence. Though
he learned the Greek language in youth, he did not begin the atudy
of Greek literatureuntil somawhat advanoed in age. (See p. 14, line
13, and Nepos, Vit. (lat. 3.) In his eighty-first year, accused of
· some capital crime, it is recorded that he defended himself iu per-

years later he was one of the most urgent advocates of the third
war against Carthago. 'l'ha writing of his Origines was continued
to the year of his death3 and only a few months before that event,
according ιο Cicero (Brutus, ch. 20), ιο made a vigorous speech in
the prosecution of Sulpicius Galba for the violation of his pledge
